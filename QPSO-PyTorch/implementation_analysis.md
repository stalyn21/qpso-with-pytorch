# Analysis of [QPSO](./tensor_qpso/qpso.py) and [QPSOo](./tensor_qpso/qpsoO.py) Codes

## Similarities
- Both use PyTorch and have a similar class structure.

## Differences
- [QPSO](./tensor_qpso/qpso.py) evaluates functions for each particle individually.
- [QPSOo](./tensor_qpso/qpsoO.py) evaluates the function for all particles simultaneously using vectorized operations.

## Improvements in [QPSOo](./tensor_qpso/qpsoO.py)
1. Evaluates in a single step using vectorization.
2. Uses broadcasting in `kernel_update`.
3. More efficient handling of best performance values.

## Conclusion
[QPSOo](./tensor_qpso/qpsoO.py) is better because it implements more efficient function evaluations. It uses vectorized operations and broadcasting, enhancing overall performance.
